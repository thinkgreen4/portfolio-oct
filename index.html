      <p> I am 27 years old and was born and raised in Salt Lake. I love the outdoors and have been an avid skier since I was three. My hobbies include skiing, music, swimming,camping, and being outdoors. I feel extremely peaceful and calm whenever I am in nature. I broke my spine when I was 13 and am paralyzed from the waist down. I still try and enjoy all of my favorite things. Some of my favorite past times are Mono-skiing and Biking. My injury has taught me a ton and really shaped who I am as a person.</p>

      <p> I graduated from the University of Utah in 20016 with a bachelor degree in Economics. The global economy and it's history have always fascinated me. I got into coding through online courses on my own and recently enrolled in a bootcamp to polish my skills. One driving force was seeing how important the tech industry has been to globalization and trade.
        This inspired me to pursue a career. Other factor driving my decision was the last collapse of the financial sector, and the security in the technology pushed me to continue my education into coding.  </p>
 
      <p> The creativity and problem solving required to build websites is what keeps me interested. I know I still have a lot to learn but really enjoy doing this. I am looking for an internship or a junior developer position. The pay is not a factor and I am more interested in getting experience and my foot in the door. I would rather be part of a project that teaches me than getting payed well doing basic repetitive tasks. </p>
